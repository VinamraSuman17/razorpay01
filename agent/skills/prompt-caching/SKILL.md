# Prompt Caching

## Pain Signals — You Need This Pattern When:

- Repeated calls share a large stable prefix (system prompt, tool schemas, retrieved docs, prior turns) and you are paying full input-token cost on every turn
- TTFT (time to first token) is dominated by prefix processing, not generation
- An agent loop runs many turns within minutes; each turn re-sends the full transcript
- A subagent fork inherits parent context — without caching, the fork pays the parent's prefix cost again
- Cost-per-session is high and dominated by input tokens, not output

**Caching is free latency and ~90% input-token cost reduction on hits.** If your harness has stable prefixes and you are not measuring `cache_read_input_tokens`, you are leaving money on the table.

---

## Core Principle

The Anthropic API hashes a **prefix** of your request and stores the model's internal KV state keyed by that prefix. A subsequent request whose first N bytes match a live cache entry skips re-processing those N bytes — the model resumes from saved state.

```
Request A:  [system][tools][history............][new turn]
                                ▲
                                cache_control breakpoint
                                ↓
                            cache write (5min TTL)

Request B:  [system][tools][history............][different turn]
            └─────────── prefix match ──────────┘
                                ▲
                                cache hit → ~10% cost, faster TTFT
```

Two rules govern everything:

1. **Prefix match is byte-exact.** Any change before the breakpoint — even a timestamp, reordered tool, or whitespace — invalidates the cache.
2. **Breakpoints are explicit.** You mark up to 4 cache breakpoints with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`. The cache stores state up to each marked block.

---

## Mechanics (Anthropic-specific)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| TTL | 5 min default; 1 hour with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral", "ttl": "1h"}` |
| Max breakpoints | 4 per request |
| Min cacheable prefix | 1024 tokens (Sonnet/Opus); 2048 (Haiku) — below this, breakpoint is ignored |
| Write cost | ~1.25× normal input tokens (5min) / ~2× (1h) |
| Read cost | ~0.1× normal input tokens |
| Refresh on hit | Yes — every cache hit resets the TTL clock |
| Scope | Per-organization, per-model |

Response includes `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` and `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`. **If both are zero, caching is not happening — investigate.**

---

## Breakpoint Placement

Order request blocks **most stable → most volatile**. Place breakpoints at the boundary between tiers.

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ system prompt (stable)         │
├────────────────────────────────┤
│ tool definitions (stable)      │  ◀── breakpoint 1 (rarely changes)
├────────────────────────────────┤
│ retrieved context / KB docs    │  ◀── breakpoint 2 (per-session stable)
├────────────────────────────────┤
│ conversation history           │  ◀── breakpoint 3 (grows turn by turn)
├────────────────────────────────┤
│ current user turn              │     (no breakpoint — volatile)
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Recipe: stable agent harness

```python
def build_request(system, tools, kb_docs, history, user_turn):
    return {
        "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
        "system": [
            {"type": "text", "text": system, "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},
        ],
        "tools": [
            *[{**t} for t in tools[:-1]],
            {**tools[-1], "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},
        ],
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": kb_docs, "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},
            ]},
            *history[:-1],
            # Mark the last history turn — caches the entire conversation prefix
            {"role": history[-1]["role"], "content": [
                *coerce_blocks(history[-1]["content"][:-1]),
                {**history[-1]["content"][-1], "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}},
            ]},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_turn},
        ],
    }
```

The fourth breakpoint (rolling, on the last history block) is the high-value one for agent loops: each turn caches the *previous* turn, so the next turn hits the cache.

---

## Ordering Rules

Cache hits depend on byte-identical prefix. Every harness must enforce these:

1. **Stable serialization.** JSON key order, whitespace, escaping must be deterministic. `json.dumps(d)` without `sort_keys=True` will silently break caching when dict iteration order changes.
2. **Stable tool order.** If your harness builds the tools array from a dict or set, the order may shift between processes. Sort by tool name.
3. **No timestamps in cached regions.** A `"current time: 2026-05-06T14:23:01Z"` line in the system prompt invalidates the cache every second. Move volatile context to the unmarked tail.
4. **No per-request IDs in cached regions.** Request IDs, trace IDs, session IDs go after the last breakpoint or in metadata, not in the system prompt.
5. **Stable model ID.** Cache is per-model. Routing between Opus and Sonnet creates two independent cache lines — factor this into routing decisions.

---

## TTL Selection

| Scenario | TTL |
|----------|-----|
| Interactive agent loop, sub-minute turn cadence | 5 min (default) |
| Long-running session with idle gaps (user thinking, tool latency) | 1 hour |
| Batch processing same prefix across many independent requests | 1 hour |
| Single-shot calls | None — caching costs more than it saves |

Cache hits **refresh** the TTL. So a 5-min TTL is fine even for hours-long sessions, *if turns happen at least every 5 min*. If turn cadence is uneven (e.g., user away from keyboard), upgrade to 1h to avoid repaying the write cost.

**Anti-pattern:** defaulting to 1h "just in case." You pay 2× write cost up front; only worth it if expected idle gap > 5 min.

---

## Measurement

Every harness must surface cache metrics. Without measurement, caching breaks silently.

```python
def log_cache_metrics(usage, span):
    write = usage.get("cache_creation_input_tokens", 0)
    read = usage.get("cache_read_input_tokens", 0)
    raw_input = usage.get("input_tokens", 0)
    total_input = write + read + raw_input
    hit_rate = read / total_input if total_input else 0.0
    span.set_attributes({
        "cache.write_tokens": write,
        "cache.read_tokens": read,
        "cache.uncached_tokens": raw_input,
        "cache.hit_rate": hit_rate,
    })
```

Dashboard should show:

- **Hit rate** per session, per agent, per harness version. A drop from 0.85 → 0.10 between deploys means a serialization regression — investigate immediately.
- **Cost decomposition.** Write tokens × 1.25, read tokens × 0.1, raw × 1.0. The harness's value is read-token share.
- **TTL waste.** Sessions where write happened but no subsequent read (cache written, never used). Suggests TTL too short or cadence mismatch.

---

## Fork-and-Share-Cache

When a parent agent forks a subagent that inherits context, the fork's first turn should hit the parent's cache.

```
Parent at turn N:  [system][tools][history N]  ◀── cache write
                                                 │
                          ┌──────────────────────┘
                          ▼
Fork starts:       [system][tools][history N][fork instructions]
                   └──── prefix match ────┘   └── cache miss tail ──┘
```

Conditions:

- Fork uses **identical** system, tools, and history serialization as parent (same harness, same code path)
- Fork starts within TTL window
- Fork is to the **same model** as parent

If your harness rebuilds the request differently for forks (e.g., adds a "you are a subagent" preamble *before* the system prompt), you destroy the prefix match. Append fork-specific content **after** the last cache breakpoint.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Timestamp in system prompt | Hit rate ≈ 0 | Move to message tail or metadata |
| Non-deterministic JSON serialization | Hit rate flaps | `sort_keys=True`, stable key order |
| Tool array reordered | Hit rate degrades after deploys | Sort tools by name at request build |
| Breakpoint below min token threshold | Cache silently not written | Combine small blocks; verify >1024 tokens |
| 5+ breakpoints attempted | API error | Choose the 4 highest-value boundaries |
| Caching the user turn | No hit (every user turn differs) | Place last breakpoint on prior assistant message, not current user message |
| Different model per turn | Two cache lines, low hit rate per line | Sticky routing within a session |
| Cache-control on every block | Wasted budget; only 4 honored anyway | Place exactly at tier boundaries |

---

## When NOT to Cache

- **Single-shot calls.** Write cost (1.25×) is unrecovered. Cache only when expecting ≥2 hits within TTL.
- **Highly volatile prefixes.** If the system prompt or tools change every call, caching costs more than it saves.
- **Below min-token threshold.** Breakpoint is ignored; you pay full price anyway.
- **Cross-model routing dominant path.** Each model has its own cache; routing diversity kills hit rate. Either pin model per session or accept lower cache value.

- [ ] JSON serialization is deterministic (sorted keys, stable whitespace)
- [ ] Tool array is sorted before request build
- [ ] No timestamps, request IDs, or per-call identifiers above the last breakpoint
- [ ] TTL chosen based on expected turn cadence (5min default; 1h only if idle gaps likely)
- [ ] `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` surfaced in telemetry
- [ ] Hit rate alarm in place — drops between deploys flagged automatically
- [ ] Fork/subagent paths verified to inherit parent cache (same model, same serialization)
- [ ] Model routing decisions account for cache-line fragmentation
