# Tool Sandboxing

## Pain Signals — You Need This Pattern When:

- Tools can execute arbitrary code (`Bash`, `python`, `node -e`) and a hallucinated command could damage the host
- Tools fetch URLs, and a prompt-injected URL could exfiltrate secrets or pivot internally
- Tools have ambient credentials (cloud SDK, kubeconfig) that grant far more than the task requires
- Untrusted input (user uploads, web pages, third-party APIs) reaches the LLM and shapes tool calls — prompt injection is realistic
- The harness runs as a service for multiple users; one user's session must not affect another's

**Two distinct goals.** Safety sandboxing prevents accidents (rm -rf typos). Security sandboxing prevents adversaries (prompt injection driving exfiltration). Same mechanisms, different threat models — and security sandboxing is strictly harder. If your threat model includes an attacker, accept that defense-in-depth is required.

---

## Core Principle

Treat the tool layer as **untrusted by default**. The trust boundary is between the harness core (your code, your decisions) and tool execution (model-driven, prompt-injectable). Everything the model can cause to happen must be bounded explicitly.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ harness core (trusted)                 │
│                                        │
│   policy / permission / audit          │
└─────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
              │ tool call
              ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ sandbox boundary                       │
│                                        │
│   ┌──────────────────────────────┐     │
│   │ tool execution (untrusted)   │     │
│   │  - jailed fs                 │     │
│   │  - egress allowlist          │     │
│   │  - scoped credentials        │     │
│   │  - resource caps             │     │
│   └──────────────────────────────┘     │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Threat Model

Enumerate before designing controls:

| Threat | Source | Mitigation tier |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Hallucinated destructive command | Model | Permission gate + safety sandbox |
| Prompt injection from web/file content | External input via tool result | Security sandbox + egress limits |
| Credential exfiltration | Compromised tool args | Scoped creds, no ambient auth |
| Lateral movement (cloud, k8s) | Tool with admin scope | Least privilege, short-lived creds |
| Denial-of-service (fork bomb, fill disk) | Hallucinated or malicious | Resource caps |
| Cross-user data leak | Multi-tenant harness | Per-session isolation |

If an attacker is in scope, prompt injection is the dominant threat; assume any text the model reads can become instructions.

---

## Filesystem Jail

Bound what tool execution can read and write.

| Mechanism | Strength | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Cwd convention only | None | Free; safety-only |
| Path validation in tool | Weak (race conditions) | Cheap |
| Bind-mounted overlay | Medium | Containers; per-session workspace |
| Linux landlock / OpenBSD pledge | Strong, in-process | Kernel support; per-process |
| Container fs (read-only root + rw workdir) | Strong | Container runtime |
| MicroVM (firecracker) | Strongest | Heaviest |

Defaults that work for most harnesses:

- **Workspace path is the only writable area.** Everything else read-only or invisible.
- **No traversal escapes.** Resolve symlinks, reject `..` after canonicalization.
- **System paths invisible.** `/etc/shadow`, `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.config` not in the sandbox view.
- **Per-session workspace.** Sessions cannot see each other's files.

---

## Network Egress

The most-overlooked control. A sandboxed shell that can `curl example.com` is an exfiltration channel.

| Policy | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| **Default-deny + allowlist** | Production, untrusted input |
| **Default-allow + denylist (cloud metadata, internal CIDRs)** | Dev convenience; weak |
| **No network** | Strict; tools must declare net needs |

Allowlist must include:

- Whatever APIs the harness genuinely needs
- DNS over a controlled resolver (so allowlist is by hostname, not raw IP)

Block list always includes:

- Cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`)
- RFC1918 / link-local unless explicitly allowed
- IPv6 unique-local unless allowed

Enforce at network namespace / firewall, not in the tool. In-tool URL validation is bypassable (DNS rebinding, redirects).

---

## Exec Isolation

For tools that run code:

| Mechanism | When |
|-----------|------|
| Subprocess with rlimits | Single-user dev tool, low risk |
| Container per call | Production, moderate risk |
| MicroVM per call | Untrusted code (CI runners, sandbox-as-a-service) |
| WASM | Pure-compute tools, no syscall surface |

Per-call vs per-session containers: per-call gives clean state but high startup cost; per-session is cheaper but accumulates state. Default to per-session with resettable workspace; per-call for high-risk tools.

Resource caps are non-optional:

```
cpu:    bounded (cgroup quota)
memory: bounded (OOM kill)
pids:   bounded (no fork bombs)
disk:   bounded (no fill-the-disk)
time:   wall-clock timeout
```

---

## Credential Scoping

The sandbox is only as good as the credentials inside it.

- **No ambient cloud auth.** No `~/.aws`, no instance metadata access, no kube-context.
- **Pass scoped tokens explicitly.** Tool that calls GitHub gets a token with the minimum repo scope, not the user's full PAT.
- **Short TTL.** Tokens expire in minutes, not hours.
- **Per-session or per-call issuance.** Audit which call used which token.
- **Never log credentials.** Redact before transcript and telemetry.

```python
class ScopedCredentialIssuer:
    def issue(self, *, tool: str, session: str, scope: list[str], ttl_seconds: int = 300):
        ...
```

The bar: a compromised tool execution should be able to do *only* what was issued, for *only* this session, for *only* a few minutes.

---

## Safety vs Security

Mechanisms are similar; rigor required differs by an order of magnitude.

| Concern | Safety mode | Security mode |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Path traversal | Reject `..` | Reject `..`, resolve symlinks, canonicalize, retry-resolve, kernel-level jail |
| Egress | Block obvious bad hosts | Default-deny allowlist, block metadata, DNS pinning |
| Auth | Limit user-context | No ambient creds, scoped short-lived tokens |
| Resources | Reasonable caps | Hard caps + monitoring + alarm |
| Validation | Trust the harness | Assume harness can be tricked; sandbox catches what gates miss |

If the threat model has an attacker, you are in security mode. Don't design as if it's safety mode and hope.

---

## Escape Hatches

Some tools genuinely need elevated capability (deployment, infra changes). Don't widen the sandbox; build a narrow trapdoor.

- Operation-specific (not blanket)
- Logged with full context
- Approved at issuance, not at use
- Time-limited
- Revocable mid-session

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Path validation in user-space tool | TOCTOU race or symlink bypass | Kernel-level jail |
| Sandbox without egress control | Exfiltration channel via curl | Default-deny network |
| Cloud metadata reachable | IMDS attack works | Block 169.254.169.254 explicitly |
| Ambient creds in env | Compromise = full account | Scoped tokens passed per call |
| Sandbox shared across users | Cross-tenant leak | Per-session isolation |
| Fork bomb crashes host | DoS | pids cgroup limit |
| Same sandbox per session, never reset | State accumulates between tasks | Reset workspace at task boundary |
| In-tool URL allowlist | Bypassable via redirect | Network-layer enforcement |
| "Trusted" tools skip sandbox | One bad tool defeats the boundary | All tools in sandbox; trusted ones get more capability *inside* the sandbox |

---

## When NOT to Use (Heavy Sandboxing)

- **Local single-user dev tool, no untrusted input.** Subprocess + permission gates may be enough.
- **Tools are pure compute (math, format, parse).** Restrict syscalls instead of full container.
- **Read-only research agents** with no shell, no fs writes, no auth tokens.

But "we trust our users" is not a reason to skip the egress allowlist if untrusted input ever reaches the model. Web pages, PR descriptions, and email bodies are untrusted input.

## Design Checklist

- [ ] Threat model explicit: safety only, or security (attacker in scope)
- [ ] Trust boundary documented; tool execution treated as untrusted past the boundary
- [ ] Filesystem jail: writable workspace, system paths invisible, no symlink escape
- [ ] Network: default-deny with allowlist; metadata services blocked; DNS controlled
- [ ] No ambient credentials in sandbox; scoped short-lived tokens issued per call
- [ ] Resource caps: cpu, memory, pids, disk, wall-clock — all enforced
- [ ] Per-session isolation; sessions cannot see each other's workspace or processes
- [ ] Tool args and credentials redacted before transcript and telemetry
- [ ] Escape hatches narrow, logged, time-limited, revocable
- [ ] Sandbox failures fail closed (block tool) by default, not open
- [ ] Periodic review: enumerate every reachable network, fs path, and credential scope from inside the sandbox
- [ ] Coordination with permission-gates skill: gates decide intent; sandbox enforces capability
