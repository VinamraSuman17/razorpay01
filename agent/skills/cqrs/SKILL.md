# CQRS — Command Query Responsibility Segregation

*Sources: Greg Young (2010); Martin Fowler — bliki/CQRS; Vaughn Vernon — Implementing DDD (2013)*

## Pain Signals — You Are in This Branch When:

- Read queries are slow because the domain model's shape is optimised for writes, not reads
- Complex reporting requires loading and traversing large object graphs just to flatten them for display
- Read and write load profiles are very different and need to scale independently
- The domain model is rich and correct for writes but awkward to query from
- Event sourcing is in use and projections are needed for efficient reads

**Before applying CQRS, confirm the pain exists.** Fowler's warning: "CQRS is a significant mental leap for all concerned, so shouldn't be tackled unless the benefit is worth that leap."

---

## Core Principle

**Commands** change state and return nothing (or minimal acknowledgement).
**Queries** read state and change nothing — calling a query twice returns the same result given no intervening commands.

These two concerns have fundamentally different requirements. Optimise them separately.

---

## The Spectrum — Apply Only What the Problem Demands

```
Minimal                  Moderate                    Full
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Single model             Separate handlers           Separate models
Same DB                  Same DB                     Separate DBs
No projections           Direct DB reads             Event-driven projections
                         in query handlers           Read stores
```

**Most systems need at most the moderate level.** Full CQRS with separate read/write stores and event-sourced projections is a significant commitment — justified only in specific circumstances.

---

## Commands

A command is an **intent to change state**. It may be rejected. It returns nothing meaningful on success (or just an ID if a resource was created).

```python
# Command — named in imperative form
@dataclass
class SubmitOrderCommand:
    order_id: OrderId
    submitted_by: UserId

class SubmitOrderHandler:
    def handle(self, cmd: SubmitOrderCommand) -> None:
        # Validate first — reject invalid commands before touching the domain
        order = self._orders.find_by_id(cmd.order_id)
        if order is None:
            raise OrderNotFound(cmd.order_id)

        order.submit()               # domain logic enforced in the aggregate
        self._orders.save(order)
        self._events.publish(order.pop_events())
```

**Rules**:
- Commands are validated before execution — reject clearly invalid commands with a descriptive error
- One handler per command type
- Handler is thin orchestration — domain logic stays in domain objects
- Commands do not return domain objects — fire-and-react, not fire-and-inspect

---

## Queries

A query **reads and returns data**. It has no side effects. It does not need to go through the domain model.

```python
# Query — named after what it returns
@dataclass
class GetOrderSummaryQuery:
    order_id: OrderId

class GetOrderSummaryHandler:
    def handle(self, query: GetOrderSummaryQuery) -> OrderSummaryDto:
        # Can read directly from DB — no domain model required
        row = self._db.query_one("""
            SELECT id, status, customer_name, total_cents, item_count, submitted_at
            FROM order_summaries
            WHERE id = %s
        """, (str(query.order_id),))
        if row is None:
            raise OrderNotFound(query.order_id)
        return OrderSummaryDto(**row)
```

**Key insight**: queries bypass the domain model entirely. They read from the database (or a read-optimised projection) directly. This is where significant performance gains come from — no object graph loading, no mapping overhead.

---

## Read Models (Projections)

In full CQRS, the read side maintains **denormalised views** built by consuming domain events. These are optimised for specific query shapes.

```python
class OrderSummaryProjection:
    """Keeps the read model up to date by consuming domain events."""

    def on_order_submitted(self, event: OrderSubmitted) -> None:
        self._read_db.upsert('order_summaries', {
            'id': str(event.order_id),
            'status': 'submitted',
            'customer_id': str(event.customer_id),
            'total_cents': event.total.in_cents(),
            'item_count': event.item_count,
            'submitted_at': event.submitted_at.isoformat()
        })

    def on_order_shipped(self, event: OrderShipped) -> None:
        self._read_db.update('order_summaries',
            where={'id': str(event.order_id)},
            values={'status': 'shipped', 'shipped_at': event.shipped_at.isoformat()}
        )
```

**Trade-off**: read models are **eventually consistent** with the write side. The lag is typically milliseconds to seconds but must be explicitly acceptable to the business for every use case.

## When CQRS Is Warranted

- Read and write performance requirements diverge significantly (heavy reads, complex writes)
- Complex reporting requirements are painful or slow through the normalised domain model
- Event sourcing is already in use (CQRS pairs naturally — the event log is the write side)
- Read and write workloads need to scale on different infrastructure
- Multiple specialised read models serve different query shapes from the same write model

## When CQRS Is Overkill

- Simple CRUD with little domain logic
- Small team where the cognitive overhead outweighs the benefit
- Strong read consistency is required everywhere — eventual read models do not satisfy the requirement
- Early in the project before read/write patterns are understood
- The application is read-heavy with simple writes — a single indexed query model is sufficient

---

## Design Checklist

- [ ] Commands named in imperative form; queries named after what they return
- [ ] Commands return nothing (or just an ID) — never domain objects
- [ ] Queries have no side effects — safe to call repeatedly
- [ ] Query handlers read directly, bypassing domain model where appropriate
- [ ] Read models are explicitly documented as eventually consistent, with acceptable lag confirmed
- [ ] Full CQRS with separate stores adopted only where trade-offs are consciously accepted
- [ ] Command validation happens before the handler executes domain logic
- [ ] The level of CQRS separation matches the actual problem — not applied speculatively
